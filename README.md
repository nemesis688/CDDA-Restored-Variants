# CDDA-Restored-Variants
CDDA mod that adds back cut variants of various items

Added back phone cases, plushies (minus like two that were basically replaced with minor changes), gum, stockings, and holy symbols.


# Notes as of 2/14/2025
The stockings textures were already removed from the MSXotto tileset.
  No clue what the policy is about redristributing the textures so I left them out.
Holy symbols variants don't really spawn right if you use Bombastic Perks and/or Xedra Evolved. Both mods use "copy-from" to add new flags to the item but "copy-from" doesn't properly carry over variant data. The entire list needs to be replpaced (even if no changes are made to the field) for it to work correctly.
The variant data is still technically there but all you will see is the generic base item 'Holy Symbol'

# Notes 2
If you use Aftershock the smartphone case can now hold the Atomic and Wraition smartphones. 
  Had to slightly increase the cases max carry weight and add the phones to its item restriction list.
I also added a mod_interaction folder for both Bombastic Perks and Xedra Evolved to add the flag and keep the variants intact. Having both does apply both flags and keep the list.
